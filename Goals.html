										<h1>SMART Goals</h1>
									</header>
								
								
						
								<div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
									<h2>Goal #1: Wellness and Life Balance Skills Domain</h2>
									<p>To better my health, I would like to make it a goal to exercise at least twice a week (whether that be going to the gym, the pool, or doing an at-home workout).<p\>
								</div>

								
								<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
									<h2>Goal #2: Wellness and Life Balance / Creative and Critical Thinking Skills Domains</h2>
									<p>I often let my hobbies that seem less important than my work fall to the wayside when I get busy, and then have trouble picking them back up later. To encourage myself to continue doing the things I enjoy continuously (and thus establish a better work-life balance and productively use my downtime), I will set the goal to do at least 20 minutes of leisure reading each day.<p\>
								</div>

								<div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
									<h2>Goal #3: Interpersonal Skills / Communication / Career Development Skills Domains</h2>
									<p>To better prepare myself for life as a professional and learn more about what career opportunities are available to me, I will find opportunities to attend talks, conferences, and network with established professionals in the field of atmospheric physics. The networking portion of this goal allows me to work on bettering my communication and interpersonal relationship skills, in addition to helping me to move toward my eventual career.<p\>
								</div>

								<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
									<h2>Goal #4: Research and Project Management Skills Domain</h2>
									<p>In doing my research this past ~2 years, I have found that my file management is lacking. Often when going back to try and find a plot, or a bit of code, I have to spend a lot of time searching through various folders and then may or may not be able to find what I am looking for. I want to take the time to establish a good organization system for my files, with everything organized and named clearly and appropriately, all in one location (on my hard drive) and make it a habit to back up my work to OneDrive at least once per week.<p\>
