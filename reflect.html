										<h3>Goal #1 -- Exercising</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
                                            <p>This goal is targeting something that I have been meaning to work on for several years: getting more exercise. Ever since graduating from high school and leaving behind all my organized sports, I have found it difficult to exercise regularly. It is all too easy for me to do other, more enjoyable tasks when exercise is not a part of my regular routine. As is reflected in my “discipline” Clifton Strength and “judging” 16Personalities type, I thrive when I have a well-defined and planned out schedule. Therefore, to be able to accomplish this goal I knew that I would need to establish exercise as part of my weekly routine. To do this, I signed up for a gym membership and went with a friend 3 times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>

 

                                            <p>One of the reasons that up until now I had not incorporated working out into my schedule was that I did not prioritize it ahead of other things in my life. When I am busy with things that I think more important, like schoolwork, it does not make sense to me take the time to go to the gym. Because of this, it is helpful to have a friend to go with. Having another person expecting me to show up forces me to go, even when I may think it would be so much easier not to. </p>  
                                                
                                                 
                                                
                                            <p>Looking back on these past few months of following this goal, I can see how important it is for me to have a defined schedule, and external motivation for accomplishing this task, which is good for me, but I just do not want to do. I am happy that I have now established this routine, so that I can continue to exercise as part of my regular schedule and reap the physical and mental rewards.  </p>

                                        <h3>Goal #2 -- Reading</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
                                            <p>My “achiever” Clifton Strength shines through in the energy that I put into my schoolwork. For the four years of my undergrad, I devoted a large portion of my time to my studies and as a result my hobbies and social life were placed on the back burner. I found that when I put so much of my time and energy into school, I experienced burn out. Because of this experience, I want to place a greater importance on maintaining a good work-life balance going into the future. To help me to use my spare time to engage in the hobbies that I enjoy rather than do the easy thing and rotting on my phone, I have made it a goal to read for at least 20 minutes per day.</p>

 

                                            <p>Despite reading being one of my favourite pass-times, I find that it can be difficult to get myself away from doing other things to sit down and read. Having this goal helped me to be mindful of how I was spending my time and motivated me to read. I found through following this goal that I would very often continue past my minimum threshold of 20 minutes. The problem was less that I did not have time to read, but rather that I was not good at overcoming the obstacle of getting started in the first place. This seems like a silly obstacle to have, but it appears in many facets of my life where I need only get over the hurdle of getting myself into a situation to accomplish the things I need to.</p>  
                                                
                                                 
                                                
                                            <p>This goal has helped me to establish reading once again as a part of my routine and has excited me to do more. After this experience, I will continue to push myself to pursue reading and other tasks that bring me joy. </p>
                                        </div>

											<p> Time spend reading per day between Feb 28 and Jul 31, 2023. I met my goal most days (on a couple of travel days I even exceeded it by several hours). </p>

										<div class="col-1"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pages_vs_yr.png" alt="" /></span></div>													
										<p> Using data from Goodreads where I have been logging the books I have read for the past several years, I compared the number of pages read between March and August for the past 4 years. In doing this, I found that this goal has motivated me to read more pages than I have for the past 4 years (it looks like I may return to pre-undergrad levels). </p>
                                            </div>
                                        </div>

										<h3>Goal #3 -- Career</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
                                            <p>Looking to next year I should be finishing up my master’s, and then I will need to find a job. When going into the job search, I will ideally have a good idea of what kind of job I can obtain with my education and have a network of professionals I can speak with. To try and get myself better set up to enter the job force, I have made it a goal for myself to get out of my comfort zone and look for opportunities to network and learn more about the field of atmospheric physics.  

												As can be inferred from the strong inclination toward introversion shown in my 16Personalities, social settings are not where I am most comfortable. Therefore, this goal is something that I need to work towards.  </p>

 

                                            <p>As is discussed through many case studies in Susan Cain’s novel, Quiet, there are many positive attributes that are found in the introverted way of thinking, however the world is set up in way which benefits one’s ability to excel at more stereotypically “extroverted” activities. One place where I think this applies is with networking. In May of this year, I had the opportunity to attend a scientific conference where I presented my research, spoke with professionals in the atmospheric physics field, and attended a very focussed job fair. This conference helped towards fulfilling my goal and gave me the chance to practise getting out of my comfort zone to speak with other conference attendees. I learned a lot at the conference and was happy to meet professionals and learn more about career opportunities. I was able to have a good experience because of the way that I actively participated in the different sessions and activities, however there were times where I could have done more to engage with others. Going forward from this experience, I know that I need to continue to actively work on coming out of my shell at these kinds of events so that I can get the most out of the experience. </p>

										<h3>Goal #4 -- Research data management</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
                                            <p>I started to work as an undergraduate research assistant 2 years ago. I quickly accumulated many files of data, code, and plots without having any semblance of a systematic file system. As a result, I have found it difficult to locate files that I was working with once I move onto new things. This issue with digital organization was not resolved when I started my master’s, and I have continued to accumulate more and more files which get sorted away in a file system which does not quite work for me.  </p>

 

                                            <p>In the fall of last year, I attended a seminar on research data management which made me think about my system and how I should improve it. In this seminar, I learned about documentation, proper version history and file labelling, and procedure for backing up research files. Through making this goal, I have taken on the large undertaking of correcting the management of my research data. I have begun to back up my files to OneDrive regularly, so that they are on both my hard drive and in cloud storage. With new files I have been generating, I have become more careful about proper labelling and keeping track of versions. As a result, I have found that it is much easier to be find the things that I need, and to be confident that I am not going to accidentally use an outdated version of something. </p>  
											<p>Maintaining good practises for digital file storage is something that I will have to continue to work on, and I think will help in all future endeavors, both personal and professional. Following this goal has helped me to put into place the things I learned in the research management seminar, and to correct the mistakes I have made which created confusion with my files.  </p>

										<h3>Final Reflection</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 100%">
                                            <p>This program was an opportunity to do something I do not enjoy doing and therefore don’t often do: talk about myself. Through personality and strengths tests, class discussions, and reflective writing, this program presented many chances for me to think about and reflect on many things, including my communication and working style, my mindset, and my approach to solving problems. Despite my Clifton Strengths indicating that I am a very reflective person, this thinking does not often turn to introspection. I don’t usually give much thought to how my personality impacts the way I like to work and interact with others, and therefore am sometimes not able to clearly identify my hot buttons, and as a result can’t clearly discern why a simple change to plans from what I had set on in my mind rubs me the wrong way (for example). Having had the opportunity to think about and verbalize these things and think about myself in an objective context when looking at MBTI and Clifton Strengths results, I think that I am much better equipped for doing this kind of introspective thinking.   </p>

                                            <p>When choosing goals to set for myself, I was trying to think forward to what would be most beneficial for my eventual professional career. With the idea of setting goals to improve myself in this regard, I chose to focus on establishing good work-life balance with effective hobbies in my down time, working towards professional development and networking, as well as improving my research data management. I think that these goals align with my mission statement, in that I am aiming to continually learn and improve in all facets of life. I have worked towards completing these goals over the past 7 months since setting them, and now feel a sense of accomplishment from having done this. My goals have been attainable and have been an effective way for me to push myself towards doing things that I know are good for me to do. Where without having set any goals, I may have continued to not be cognizant of the ways in which I spend my time, I now attend the gym 3 times a week, and have read more this spring and summer than I have in the past 3 years. Because of the benefits that I have experienced from setting these goals, following the end of this program I will continue to strive to meet these goals and set new goals as needed to help me to continue to grow in the direction provided by my mission statement.  </p>  
											<p>My tendency towards introversion and shyness is one of the largest hurdles I face when in a group environment. My career development goal aimed to push me to work on overcoming this, in speaking and networking with other people in my field. I had an opportunity to practice this when at a conference in May, where I was able to speak with several professionals. Another place where I could work on this was during the field school, in trying to speak up in the group. During this experience I took on the “lead” role in the mechanical group, which allowed me to practice operating in a leader position and speaking in the daily debrief meetings. Being in this kind of a role does not feel natural or comfortable to me. Following some of the case studies examined in Susan Cain’s novel, Quiet, I can see that as a person with a proclivity for being more quiet, it is possible to work effectively in a group and get my ideas across without having to be one of the loud personalities. I can utilize my skills in ways that feel comfortable for me, but also push myself to be a part of the group.   </p>
											<p>Overall, this program has been a great opportunity for building skills for both introspective thought and working effectively in a group dynamic. The activities (like the MBTI and Clifton Strengths) and group discussions aimed at analyzing the most effective ways to work and communicate have for me helped to encourage a better internal discourse and understanding of my personal attributes. Despite the heavily debated merit of the MBTI and Clifton Strengths (within this course), I think that they were valuable tools in initiating thought and discussion. Building a portfolio and establishing goals are both takeaways from this program that will be useful in the future when it comes to the job search as well as moving towards my mission statement. The learning activities that I took part in during this program were beneficial to me during the class and are such that I can continue to partake and benefit from them after the course is finished. Having identified a learning coach from whom I can learn from in self-study, I think that I am better set up to use my skills to my best advantage. </p>
