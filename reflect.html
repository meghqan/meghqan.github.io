										<h3>Goal #1 -- Exercising</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
                                            <p>This goal is targeting something that I have been meaning to work on for several years: getting more exercise. Ever since graduating from high school and leaving behind all my organized sports, I have found it difficult to exercise regularly. It is all too easy for me to do other, more enjoyable tasks when exercise is not a part of my regular routine. As is reflected in my “discipline” Clifton Strength and “judging” 16Personalities type, I thrive when I have a well-defined and planned out schedule. Therefore, to be able to accomplish this goal I knew that I would need to establish exercise as part of my weekly routine. To do this, I signed up for a gym membership and went with a friend 3 times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>

 

                                            <p>One of the reasons that up until now I had not incorporated working out into my schedule was that I did not prioritize it ahead of other things in my life. When I am busy with things that I think more important, like schoolwork, it does not make sense to me take the time to go to the gym. Because of this, it is helpful to have a friend to go with. Having another person expecting me to show up forces me to go, even when I may think it would be so much easier not to. </p>  
                                                
                                                 
                                                
                                            <p>Looking back on these past few months of following this goal, I can see how important it is for me to have a defined schedule, and external motivation for accomplishing this task, which is good for me, but I just do not want to do. I am happy that I have now established this routine, so that I can continue to exercise as part of my regular schedule and reap the physical and mental rewards.  </p>

                                        <h3>Goal #2 -- Reading</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
                                            <p>My “achiever” Clifton Strength shines through in the energy that I put into my schoolwork. For the four years of my undergrad, I devoted a large portion of my time to my studies and as a result my hobbies and social life were placed on the back burner. I found that when I put so much of my time and energy into school, I experienced burn out. Because of this experience, I want to place a greater importance on maintaining a good work-life balance going into the future. To help me to use my spare time to engage in the hobbies that I enjoy rather than do the easy thing and rotting on my phone, I have made it a goal to read for at least 20 minutes per day.</p>

 

                                            <p>Despite reading being one of my favourite pass-times, I find that it can be difficult to get myself away from doing other things to sit down and read. Having this goal helped me to be mindful of how I was spending my time and motivated me to read. I found through following this goal that I would very often continue past my minimum threshold of 20 minutes. The problem was less that I did not have time to read, but rather that I was not good at overcoming the obstacle of getting started in the first place. This seems like a silly obstacle to have, but it appears in many facets of my life where I need only get over the hurdle of getting myself into a situation to accomplish the things I need to.</p>  
                                                
                                                 
                                                
                                            <p>This goal has helped me to establish reading once again as a part of my routine and has excited me to do more. After this experience, I will continue to push myself to pursue reading and other tasks that bring me joy. </p>

											<p> Time spend reading per day between Feb 28 and Jul 31, 2023. I met my goal most days (on a couple of travel days I even exceeded it by several hours). </p>

										<div class="col-1"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pages_vs_yr.png" alt="" /></span></div>													
										<p> Using data from Goodreads where I have been logging the books I have read for the past several years, I compared the number of pages read between March and August for the past 4 years. In doing this, I found that this goal has motivated me to read more pages than I have for the past 4 years (it looks like I may return to pre-undergrad levels). </p>
                                            </div>

										<h3>Goal #3 -- Career</h3>
                                        <div style="float: left; width:100%">
                                        <div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
                                            <p>Looking to next year I should be finishing up my master’s, and then I will need to find a job. When going into the job search, I will ideally have a good idea of what kind of job I can obtain with my education and have a network of professionals I can speak with. To try and get myself better set up to enter the job force, I have made it a goal for myself to get out of my comfort zone and look for opportunities to network and learn more about the field of atmospheric physics.  

												As can be inferred from the strong inclination toward introversion shown in my 16Personalities, social settings are not where I am most comfortable. Therefore, this goal is something that I need to work towards.  </p>

 

                                            <p>As is discussed through many case studies in Susan Cain’s novel, Quiet, there are many positive attributes that are found in the introverted way of thinking, however the world is set up in way which benefits one’s ability to excel at more stereotypically “extroverted” activities. One place where I think this applies is with networking. In May of this year, I had the opportunity to attend a scientific conference where I presented my research, spoke with professionals in the atmospheric physics field, and attended a very focussed job fair. This conference helped towards fulfilling my goal and gave me the chance to practise getting out of my comfort zone to speak with other conference attendees. I learned a lot at the conference and was happy to meet professionals and learn more about career opportunities. I was able to have a good experience because of the way that I actively participated in the different sessions and activities, however there were times where I could have done more to engage with others. Going forward from this experience, I know that I need to continue to actively work on coming out of my shell at these kinds of events so that I can get the most out of the experience. </p>
