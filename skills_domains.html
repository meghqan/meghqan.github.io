										<h1>Skills Domains</h1>
									</header>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
										<h2>1. Critical and creative thinking</h2>
										<p>Critical and creative thinking is a skill that I have developed through reading. In reading different texts, stories, biographies, memoirs, historical accounts, etc. I have been exposed to many different points of view. This helps to foster critical thinking, as I question the ideas proposed, and creative thinking as I am exposed to many different ideas.</p>
									</div>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
										<h2>2. Professionalism, ethics, and integrity</h2>
										<p>Professionalism, ethics, and integrity are skills that I have had the opportunity to learn throughout different experiences, but especially through professionalism courses that I was required to take in my undergrad. These courses taught about professional ethics, and it is my responsibility to apply these principles to my professional life.</p>
									</div>
									
									
									<div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
										<h2>3. Communication</h2>
										<p>Communication is an area where I feel more comfortable using written word than spoken. I would often rather send an email than make a call, or speak in person. This is something that I would like to improve upon, and have set this as part of my learning goals.</p>
									</div>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
										<h2>4. Interpersonal skills</h2>
										<p>When it comes to listening to others, I think that I am very competent. However, I sometimes flounder when it comes to other aspects of interpersonal skills, like being able to comfortably make small talk with others. Because of this, I have set it as a goal to improve my interpersonal skills.</p>
									</div>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
										<h2>5. Intercultural competence</h2>
										<p>Intercultural competence is something that I have developed through being open and aware of the experiences of other people, primarily through the consumption of novels telling the stories of people with different experiences to me, as well as through interacting with others. In the interest of continued growth and learning in the area of cultural competence, I completed the Mitacs reconcilliation and EDI course in March of this year (see certificate below).</p>

									<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
										<h2>6. Leadership</h2>
										<p>I had many opportunities for leadership in my earlier years, with positions in student leadership in high school. More recently, leadership roles have taken more the form of taking the lead role on a group project. I have not been in a leadership role often in recent years, and can work on this skills domain to better myself as a leader.</p>
									</div>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
										<h2>7. Career development</h2>
										<p>At this point, I do not have a clear path that I want to follow with regard to my future career, and I don't have a good network of professionals. To encourage myself to become better setup for entering the job search and finding a career, I have made it a goal to improve in this area.</p>
									</div>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
										<h2>8. Wellness and life balance</h2>
										<p>When I become busy with other things, I often let my work overshadow my personal life. I would like to become better at having a good work-life balance, and better at prioritizing doing things that are good for me, like exercising and practising my favourite hobbies. Becuase of this, I have made it a goal to improve in this area.</p>
									</div>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: left; width: 49%">
										<h2>9. Research and project management</h2>
										<p>Although I think of myself as an organized person, I don't have much of an organizational structure for my research data and files. I need to find a better system for tracking my progress, as well as organizing my many files. Becuase of this, improving in this area is one of my goals.</p>
									</div>

									
									<div class="box" style="float: right; width: 49%">
										<h2>10. Reflection and intrapersonal skills</h2>
										<p>This is an area that I don't practise very often. This class has been a good opportunity to do more reflection and inward thinking.</p>
